## Introduction (1/2)


This guide, written by the Coding Group of the ONDA Lab, is **a humorous collection of bad programming habits**.
While many guides explain how to write good code, we realized that another way to learn is by looking at what not to do. 


## Introduction (1/2)
After all, most of us (certainly we, at least) are naturally prone to becoming bad programmers.
So instead of only focusing on the ‚Äúright‚Äù way, this guide highlights the habits you really shouldn‚Äôt have (but probably already do).

<br>

**Enjoy!**

<br>

_P.S. If you think we‚Äôre writing this because we‚Äôre excellent programmers, you couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. But we‚Äôre trying to unlearn these bad habits!_

## 1. Write your code as a single long script

<br>

_The truth: unless you have a very short task, a very long script is often difficult to work on, to reuse, to mantain, and to share._

<br>

_Using just a long script as you typically think in a less modular way and you don't break down you problem._
